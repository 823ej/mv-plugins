Javascript plugins for RPG Maker MV

Please note: I no longer work on those plugins. You're free to use it on any kind of project (free and commercial), but I do not provide support for them anymore.

You can make any change you need (or commission someone else to change it). If you do change something, you're free to submit a pull request so I can include those changes on the plugin, but you don't need to do so if you want to keep your changes for yourself.
